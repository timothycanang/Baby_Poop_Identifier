Your baby’s poop will look drastically different during his or her
first few days after birth. Newborns have a greenish-black, tarry,
sticky poop that resembles motor oil. This is called meconium and
is made up of amniotic fluid, mucus, skin cells and other things
ingested into the utero. Two to four days after birth, you should
notice “transitional stools” that tend to be green and less tacky than meconium.
