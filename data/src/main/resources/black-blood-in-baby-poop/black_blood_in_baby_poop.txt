Oftentimes, if your baby’s poop has little specks of black blood in it,
it means a baby has digested blood while breastfeeding on his or her mother’s
cracked and bleeding nipples.
Though this does not pose a threat to your baby,
 it’s a good idea to check with a doctor to
make sure the blood is not a symptom of something more serious.
