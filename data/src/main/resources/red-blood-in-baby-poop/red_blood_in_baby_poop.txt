While your babyâ€™s poop can turn red because of something he or she ate or drank,
such as tomatoes or fruit punch, red baby poop can be a sign of blood in the stool.
Red blood found in normal poop could be a sign of a milk protein allergy,
while red blood in diarrhea could mean your baby has a bacterial infection.
